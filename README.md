# csharp snippets

**C# snippets** are ready-made snippets of code you can quickly insert into your code.

# How to Use

**Import a code snippet**
1. You can import a snippet to your Visual Studio installation by using the Code Snippets Manager. Open it by choosing Tools > Code Snippets Manager.
2. Click the Import button.
3. Go to the location where you saved the code snippet in the previous procedure, select it, and click Open.
4. The Import Code Snippet dialog opens, asking you to choose where to add the snippet from the choices in the right pane. One of the choices should be My Code Snippets. Select it and click Finish, then OK.

**Insert a code snippet**
1. You can write in Visual Studio a snippet shortcut like ```cw`` and then press double TAB using the keyboard.
2. Also, you can use another way. With a code file open in the editor, choose Snippets > Insert Snippet from the right-click menu, then My Code Snippets. Then, select a snippet and double-click it.
